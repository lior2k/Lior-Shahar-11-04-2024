## Weather App

This is a simple, responsive web application built in Angular/React to display weather information for various cities. Users can search for a city, view its current weather and 5-day forecast, and save their favorite locations locally without the need for a server.

## Features

-   Search Functionality: Users can search for a city by name to view its weather details.
-   Favorite Locations: Users can save their favorite locations locally and easily access them.
-   Responsive Design: The app is responsive and works well on various screen sizes.
-   Error Handling: Error handling is implemented using toast notifications.
-   Animations: Animations are added tastefully to enhance the user experience.

### Usage

-   Navigate to the main screen to search for a city and view its weather details.
-   Save your favorite locations by clicking the "Add to Favorites" button.
-   Access your favorite locations easily from the favorites screen.

### How to Run

> You will need to create an AccuWeather account and change the API key in the Constants folder
> Ideally this key should be hidden and stored in a seperate backend server, but for a simple app using a free API this is ok.
